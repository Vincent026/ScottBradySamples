# XML Signing using RSA and ECDSA

Sample code from my articles:

- [How to sign XML using RSA in .NET](https://www.scottbrady91.com/c-sharp/xml-signing-dotnet)
- [ECDSA and Custom XML Signatures in .NET](https://www.scottbrady91.com/c-sharp/ecdsa-xml-dotnet)

This sample is a console running app that can sign some XML using RSA or ECDSA (a custom algorithm for .NET's `SignedXml` implementation).
