# JWT Signing using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithms (ECDSA) in .NET Core

Demo code from [scottbrady91.com](https://www.scottbrady91.com/C-Sharp/JWT-Signing-using-ECDSA-in-dotnet-Core) demonstrating how to sign and validates JWTs using ECDSA.

This sample has since been updated to focus on ECDSA and JWTs.
You can find the [original sample code]((https://github.com/scottbrady91/Blog-Example-Classes/tree/1e666ff6df8b3f6f1f7e73caefb75bd4585a62d9/EcdsaJwtSigning)) in the git history.
